/**
 * UI-test isolation config (Phase 45 Task 7, QA-01).
 *
 * Addresses the 4 flaky render tests across `tests/components/*.tsx`
 * + `tests/ui/config-health-tab.test.tsx` that intermittently timed
 * out under the default vitest pool due to: (1) jsdom setup racing
 * `vi.mock()` substitution for `next/dynamic` imports, (2) PERF-01
 * lazy-registry shared module cache across workers, (3)
 * setState-on-unmount warnings leaking into assertion paths.
 *
 * Fix: run UI + component tests in a forked pool with a single fork
 * (`pool: 'forks'` + `singleFork: true`) under jsdom. Eliminates the
 * cross-worker module cache + keeps jsdom instances serialized
 * within one worker process. Timeout raised to 10 s so slow CI
 * runners don't surface false positives.
 *
 * Invocation (wired into `npm test` via package.json):
 *   npx vitest run --config vitest.ui.config.ts
 *
 * Standalone config (not `mergeConfig` with base) — the base config's
 * `include` glob would pull in all src/ + tests/ test files under
 * jsdom, which breaks the node-env tests (e.g. `src/core/url-safety.test.ts`
 * uses `import.meta.url` parsing that jsdom doesn't provide). We
 * deliberately scope this config to ONLY the render-heavy test tree.
 *
 * The default `vitest.config.ts` excludes `tests/components/**` and
 * `tests/ui/**` so render tests don't run twice.

// The `pool` + `poolOptions` options existed in vitest 3 and still
// work in vitest 4's runtime (verified: `npm run test:ui` spins up
// exactly 1 forked worker with files serialized), but vitest 4's
// `InlineConfig` type has narrowed: `poolOptions` is gated behind a
// pool-specific discriminator that flat config literals don't match.
// The shape below is cast through `as Parameters<typeof defineConfig>[0]`
// so TS accepts the known-good runtime shape. When vitest 4's types
// catch up to the flat runtime, drop the cast.
