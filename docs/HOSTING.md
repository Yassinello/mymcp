# Kebab MCP — Hosting Guide

Kebab MCP is host-agnostic. What changes between hosts is the **state
layer**: where `mymcp:*` keys live, how many processes share them, and
how graceful the shutdown story is. The matrix below picks a safe
combination for your target. Default to **Vercel + Upstash** or
**Docker single-replica + filesystem KV** if you are unsure.

For working boot examples, see [`docs/examples/`](./examples/).

## Persistence modes

Kebab MCP detects the state backend at boot from env vars alone. See
`src/core/kv-store.ts` for the selection logic.

- **Filesystem KV** (`./data/kv.json`) — durable on any persistent disk.
  **NOT safe across replicas** — each process holds its own copy. Perfect
  for single-replica Docker, Fly single-machine, and bare-metal single-node.
- **Upstash KV** — durable, HTTP-based, safe across replicas. **Required**
  for any host that runs more than one process in parallel (Docker N-replica,
  Fly multi-machine, Render multi-instance, Cloud Run). Accepts both
  `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_*` (manual) and `KV_REST_API_*` (Vercel Marketplace)
  naming; see `.env.example` for details.
- **`/tmp` fallback** — used only on Vercel when Upstash is not configured,
  and only for the cold-start bootstrap handshake (`/tmp/mymcp-kv.json`).
  Ephemeral — evaporates ~15 minutes after last traffic. **Never** relied
  on for long-term persistence; treated as a last-resort cache only.

---

## Healthcheck endpoint

Two variants of `/api/health` are available:

- **`GET /api/health`** — public, cheap, returns `{ ok, version, warnings?, bootstrap?, kv? }`.
  **Use this for container `HEALTHCHECK` directives** (Docker, Fly, Cloud Run,
  Kubernetes liveness probe). It is hard-capped at 1.5s total and never
  leaks secrets.
- **`GET /api/health?deep=1`** — admin-gated (`Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_AUTH_TOKEN>`),
  runs `diagnose()` on every enabled connector. **Use this for operator
  probes** (Grafana synthetic monitors, Healthchecks.io, Better Uptime),
  NOT for container-orchestrator liveness checks — it hits external APIs
  and will take several seconds on a healthy deploy.

The root `docker-compose.yml` and the examples under `docs/examples/`
all use the basic `/api/health` path for their `HEALTHCHECK`.

---

## SIGTERM handling

Every persistent-process deployment (Docker, Fly, Render, Cloud Run,
bare-metal) runs via the `server.js` wrapper at the repo root. It
installs a SIGTERM + SIGINT handler that:

1. Logs `[shutdown] Received SIGTERM, draining in <N>ms...`.
2. Lets in-flight requests finish naturally (the wrapper does NOT close
   the HTTP server — it relies on Next's active-handle bookkeeping so
   connections flush cleanly).
3. After the drain window elapses, calls `process.exit(0)`.

Defaults:

- **Drain window:** 5000 ms.
- **Override:** `MYMCP_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS=<ms>` in the container env.
- **Minimum:** 1000 ms (the wrapper clamps small values upward).

Tune per host based on the orchestrator's termination grace period:

| Host       | Grace window  | Recommended drain       |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Docker     | 10s default   | 5000 (fits inside 10s)  |
| Fly.io     | 30s default   | 5000–10000              |
| Render     | 30s default   | 5000–10000              |
| Cloud Run  | 10s default   | 5000 (fits inside 10s)  |
| Kubernetes | `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` (default 30) | 5000–10000 |

Vercel lambdas ignore SIGTERM — the runtime SIGKILLs them at the
invocation deadline. `MYMCP_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS` is a no-op on Vercel.

## Durable logs mandatory for N-replica

When running more than one replica behind a load balancer, **set
`MYMCP_DURABLE_LOGS=1`**. Without it, each replica writes tool-call
logs to its own in-process ring buffer, and the `mcp_logs` tool will
return a non-deterministic slice depending on which replica serves the
request.

With `MYMCP_DURABLE_LOGS=1`:

- Logs aggregate in KV at the `log:*` key prefix.
- `mcp_logs` reads from KV, so every replica sees the same view.
- Retention controlled by `MYMCP_LOG_MAX_ENTRIES` and
  `MYMCP_LOG_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` (see `.env.example`).

The matrix rows for **Docker N-replica**, **Fly** (multi-machine),
**Render**, and **Cloud Run** list this as the default expectation.
Single-replica Vercel and Docker deploys are fine on the default
(`MYMCP_DURABLE_LOGS=false`) because there is only one ring buffer.

**Phase 39 note:** the code default stays `false` — we only mandate
`=1` in the deployment docs. A future milestone may auto-flip on
Upstash detection (tracked as a v0.11 follow-up).

## Upgrade: single-replica → multi-replica

Run through this checklist when graduating a filesystem-KV deploy to
a horizontally scaled one:

1. **Switch to Upstash.** Create an Upstash Redis instance (free tier
   at https://upstash.com) and set `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` +
   `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` in the deployment env.
2. **Set `MYMCP_DURABLE_LOGS=1`.** Mandatory per above.
3. **Remove the `./data` volume mount.** Once state is in Upstash,
   the filesystem mount is not used and keeping it on one replica
   risks confusion about which backend is authoritative.
4. **Rotate `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`** if the original was cached in logs
   or CI artifacts.
5. **Verify `/api/health`** returns 200 and the `kv.reachable: true`
   field from `/api/health?deep=1` confirms Upstash is live.
6. **Re-run the welcome flow** only if you need to re-claim the
   instance; otherwise existing tokens keep working.

---

## Migration checklist from Vercel to self-hosted

1. **Export env** from Vercel (`vercel env pull .env`).
2. **Decide filesystem vs Upstash.** Single-replica → filesystem is
   fine. N-replica or zero-downtime deploys → keep Upstash.
3. **Adjust `MYMCP_DURABLE_LOGS`** per the matrix (default `false` for
   single-replica, `1` for multi-replica).
4. **Rotate `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`** — the Vercel-minted token should not be
   re-used cross-environment.
5. **Boot** via `docker compose up -d` (or equivalent on Fly/Render/
   Cloud Run/bare-metal).
6. **Verify `/api/health`** returns `{ ok: true }`. Hit it via the
   container port or the LB.
7. **Run the welcome flow** if first-run state needs rebuilding — or
   copy `./data/kv.json` from a previous Docker deploy to skip.
