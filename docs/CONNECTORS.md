# Connector Authoring Guide

Practical notes for anyone building or maintaining a Kebab MCP connector.
Focused on conventions that are **not enforced by types** today, plus
the SEC-02 breaking change for credential reads.

## Files

A connector lives under `src/connectors/<id>/` with at minimum:

- `manifest.ts` — exports a `ConnectorManifest` (id, label, required
  env vars, tools array, optional `registerPrompts`, `testConnection`,
  `diagnose`).
- `tools/<tool-name>.ts` — one file per tool, exporting
  `{ schema, handler, destructive }`.
- `lib/` — API wrappers, helpers.

## Credential resolution (v0.10 breaking change — SEC-02)

**Pre-v0.10 pattern (deprecated):**

```ts
// tools/slack-send.ts
export const handler = async (params) => {
  const token = process.env.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN;
  // ...
};
```

**v0.10+ pattern (preferred):**

```ts
import { getCredential } from "@/core/request-context";

export const handler = async (params) => {
  const token = getCredential("SLACK_BOT_TOKEN");
  // ...
};
```

### What changed

`process.env.X` is no longer mutated at request time. Credentials
saved via the dashboard now flow through an in-process snapshot
consumed by `getCredential()` via request-scoped `AsyncLocalStorage`.
Connectors reading `process.env.X` directly still work — but they
only see the **boot-time snapshot**, not the dashboard-saved values
that landed on the current warm lambda between boot and the current
request.

### Migration

Grep your connector for `process.env.` reads:

```bash
rg "process\.env\." src/connectors/<yourconnector>/
```

Replace each credential read with `getCredential()`. Platform
lifecycle vars (`VERCEL`, `NODE_ENV`, `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`) are
read-through to live `process.env` via `getCredential()` too, so you
can use the helper uniformly.

### Enforcement

- **v0.10.x** — back-compat path preserved. Warnings only.
- **v0.11** — ESLint rule will block direct `process.env` reads in
  `src/connectors/**` (already blocks assignments — see SEC-02-enforce
  in the v0.10 CHANGELOG).

### Why

The pre-v0.10 pattern mutated `process.env` globally from request
handlers. On warm lambdas handling interleaved requests, that caused
torn reads (tenant A's Slack token observed by tenant B's tool call
mid-flight). See `.planning/research/RISKS-AUDIT.md` finding #3 and
`docs/SECURITY-ADVISORIES.md#sec-02`.

## Tool definitions

Each tool exports `{ schema, handler, destructive }`:

```ts
import { z } from "zod";
import type { ToolDefinition } from "@/core/types";

export const schema = {
  query: z.string().describe("Search term"),
};

export const handler = async (params: { query: string }) => {
  // ...
  return { content: [{ type: "text" as const, text: "..." }] };
};

export const destructive = false; // Set true for tools that write/delete
```

- `destructive: true` — tool may modify state (send email, delete
  row, post to Slack). Surfaced in dashboard UI and logs.
- `destructive: false` — read-only tool.

## Tenant isolation

If your connector persists data in KV, **always** use
`getContextKVStore()` from `@/core/request-context`, never
`getKVStore()` directly:

```ts
import { getContextKVStore } from "@/core/request-context";

export const handler = async () => {
  const kv = getContextKVStore();
  await kv.set("my-key", "value");
  // Writes land at `tenant:<id>:my-key` automatically when a tenant
  // context is active; at `my-key` (untenanted) otherwise.
};
```

`getKVStore()` is allowlisted in `tests/contract/kv-allowlist.test.ts`
and the allowlist enforces going forward. If you have a legitimate
global-KV need, add the file to the allowlist + document in
`INVENTORY.md`.

## Error handling

Use the sanitized `McpToolError` for errors that surface to the
caller. See `src/core/connector-errors.ts` for built-in shapes:

- `AUTH_FAILED` — 401/403 upstream
- `RATE_LIMITED` — 429 upstream
- `TIMEOUT` — upstream timed out
- `UPSTREAM_5XX` — upstream 5xx

Attach `internalRecovery` to describe operator remediation (which env
var to check, how to re-authorize). The wrapped log captures it; the
MCP response only shows the generic `recovery` string.

## Registration

Add your manifest to `src/core/registry.ts`:

```ts
import { myConnectorManifest } from "../connectors/myconnector/manifest";

const ALL_CONNECTORS: ConnectorManifest[] = [
  // ...
  myConnectorManifest,
];
```

The registry auto-activates connectors when their `requiredEnvVars`
are present. No dashboard toggle needed for new connectors — they
light up on deploy.

## Testing

- `src/connectors/<id>/manifest.test.ts` — activation + env var tests
- Per-tool tests colocated with handlers: `src/connectors/<id>/tools/<tool>.test.ts`
- `tests/contract/kv-allowlist.test.ts` will fail if you use
  `getKVStore()` directly in connector code — fix by switching to
  `getContextKVStore()`.
