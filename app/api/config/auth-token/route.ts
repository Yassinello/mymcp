 * GET /api/config/auth-token

 * Returns the first token from MCP_AUTH_TOKEN to admin-authed callers.
 * Used by the Settings → MCP install panel's "Reveal" button instead of
 * server-rendering the token into the page payload (which would leak it
 * into HTML view-source even when the UI shows it masked).
 *
 * Auth: same as other admin routes — admin cookie or Authorization header.
 *
 * v0.6 NIT-01: previously returned 404 for "no token configured" and 401
 * for "wrong creds" — that's an oracle (an attacker could differentiate
 * "token-less server" from "wrong token"). Both states now return 401 so
 * an unauthorized caller cannot tell them apart.
