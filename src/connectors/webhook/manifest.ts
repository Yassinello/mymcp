  guide: `Expose your Kebab MCP instance as a webhook target so external services (Stripe, GitHub, Zapier, Make, n8n, your own apps) can POST events that you later replay through MCP tools.

Unlike the other connectors, there's no third-party account to set up — you publish endpoints under your own deployment.

### Prerequisites
- A publicly reachable URL for this Kebab MCP instance (Vercel, Cloudflare, your own host). Localhost works too if your sender can reach it (e.g. via a tunnel like \`ngrok http 3000\`).
- Persistent storage configured (Upstash KV in production), otherwise stored payloads vanish on cold starts.

### How to set it up
1. Pick one or more **webhook names** — short, lowercase, no spaces (e.g. \`stripe\`, \`github\`, \`crm-orders\`). These become the URL paths.
2. Set \`MYMCP_WEBHOOKS\` to the comma-separated list (e.g. \`stripe,github,crm-orders\`). Names not in this allowlist are rejected with **404**.
3. Each webhook is now reachable at \`POST https://<your-host>/api/webhook/<name>\`. Configure that URL in the source service.
4. **Optional but recommended** — set a per-webhook HMAC secret to verify payload authenticity:
   - Env var: \`MYMCP_WEBHOOK_SECRET_<NAME>\` (uppercase, hyphens become underscores). Example: \`MYMCP_WEBHOOK_SECRET_CRM_ORDERS\` for a webhook named \`crm-orders\`.
   - The sender must include an \`X-Webhook-Signature\` header with the **HMAC-SHA256 hex digest** of the raw request body using that secret.
5. Fetch payloads through MCP via \`webhook_last\`, \`webhook_list\`, or \`webhook_history\`.

### Limits & defaults
- Max payload size: **1 MB** (returns **413** above that).
- Optional rate limit: **30 requests / minute / IP** when \`MYMCP_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true\`.
- History size: configurable via \`MYMCP_WEBHOOK_HISTORY_SIZE\` (default 10 most recent payloads per webhook).

### Troubleshooting
- _404 Webhook not found_: the name in the URL isn't listed in \`MYMCP_WEBHOOKS\`. Names are case-insensitive but must match the comma-separated list exactly otherwise.
- _401 Invalid signature_: signature verification is opt-in but **becomes required** the moment \`MYMCP_WEBHOOK_SECRET_<NAME>\` is set. Either remove the secret or compute \`X-Webhook-Signature\` correctly on the sender.
- _Payloads disappear after a few minutes_: you're on Vercel without Upstash — \`/tmp\` storage is recycled. Configure Upstash in **Storage** to persist.
- _Connector stays "Inactive" after saving_: \`MYMCP_WEBHOOKS\` must be **non-empty**. An empty list disables the connector entirely.`,
