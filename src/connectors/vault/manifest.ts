  guide: `Read, write, search, and link notes in an Obsidian vault that lives inside a GitHub repository. Every write becomes a git commit, so you get full history for free.

### Prerequisites
An Obsidian vault pushed to a **private GitHub repo** (public works too, but private is recommended for personal notes). The repo can be empty at first — MyMCP will create notes in it.

### How to get credentials
1. Go to [github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new) and create a **fine-grained** personal access token
2. Under **Repository access**, pick _Only select repositories_ and choose your vault repo
3. Grant **Contents: Read and write** and **Metadata: Read-only**
4. Copy the token into \`GITHUB_PAT\`
5. Set \`GITHUB_REPO\` to \`owner/repo\` (e.g. \`yassine/my-vault\`)
6. Optional: override the default branch with \`GITHUB_BRANCH\` (defaults to \`main\`)

### Troubleshooting
- _404 on the repo_: the token wasn't granted access to that specific repo — edit it and add it.
- _409 conflict on write_: someone (or another sync) committed between your read and write; retry — MyMCP passes \`sha\` to handle this.
- _Search returns nothing fresh_: GitHub's search index lags by 1–2 minutes after a commit; that's normal.`,
