/**
 * withBootstrapRehydrate — DUR-02
 *
 * HOC wrapping a Next.js route handler. Ensures `rehydrateBootstrapAsync()`
 * runs before the inner handler, so any auth-gated / bootstrap-aware
 * handler that reads MCP_AUTH_TOKEN or calls isFirstRunMode() sees the
 * durable state rehydrated from /tmp or KV on cold lambdas.
 *
 * Every auth-gated route under `app/api/**` should either be wrapped in
 * this HOC or carry a `// BOOTSTRAP_EXEMPT: <reason>` marker in the first
 * 10 lines of the file. See the `route-rehydrate-coverage` contract test.
 *
 * Also triggers the one-shot v0.10 tenant-prefix migration on the FIRST
 * invocation per process (module-flag gated, fire-and-forget annotated).
 * Moved here from `first-run.ts` — the migration trigger used to fire on
 * every `rehydrateBootstrapAsync()` call, which made test order depend
 * on a module-load disk-I/O side effect (see ARCH-AUDIT §3).
 *
 * @see .planning/milestones/v0.10-durability-ROADMAP.md DUR-01..03

 *
 * Generic `H` preserves the caller's exact signature (including ctx type
 * for dynamic routes like `[id]/route.ts`) — `wrapped as H` is a safe
 * cast because the wrapper forwards `...rest` verbatim. Using `never[]`
 * on the bound keeps `H` contravariant so routes with typed ctx (e.g.
