/**
 * v0.10 Migration — Move legacy un-prefixed `cred:*` and `skills:*`
 * keys into the default-tenant namespace.
 *
 * Pre-v0.10, connector stores (skills, credential-store) wrote KV
 * keys at the global prefix (`skills:all`, `cred:SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`).
 * SEC-01 tenant-scoped those callsites to `getContextKVStore()`,
 * which routes them through `tenant:<id>:...` when a tenant context
 * is active and through the unprefixed path when no context is.
 *
 * For single-tenant deploys that upgraded from pre-v0.10, the
 * legacy un-prefixed keys still exist — but the code now reads from
 * the tenant-null path, which is still the un-prefixed path. So
 * strictly speaking, no migration is required for backwards
 * compatibility on single-tenant deploys.
 *
 * However, for multi-tenant deploys or for any operator who
 * retroactively enables the `x-mymcp-tenant` header, legacy keys
 * become invisible. This migration copies them into an explicit
 * default-tenant namespace (`tenant::cred:...` — empty tenantId,
 * which is distinct from the null-tenant unprefixed path) so that
 * operators can explicitly retrieve them via a `?tenant=default`
 * CLI tool later if needed.
 *
 * Actually — simpler semantics: leave legacy keys in place. The
 * null-tenant code path already reads them. This migration is
 * therefore **a no-op** in the common case; we only document the
 * idempotency marker in KV and log the count.
 *
 * Idempotency marker: `mymcp:migrations:v0.10-tenant-prefix`. Once
 * set to "completed", the migration does not re-run.
